The XML format lets us easily read the inverted index for debugging. You should carefully consider
how the program may break and code it robustly. You should outline and implement a strategy to deal
with potential problems and inconsistencies. For example, if a file already exists with the same name
as the inverted-index file name, you should ask the user if they wish to overwrite it. If the name of the
directory or file you want to index does not exist, your indexer should print an error message and exit
gracefully rather than crash. There are many other error cases that you ought to consider.
