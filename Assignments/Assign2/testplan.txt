In order to test the recursive traversing process, we create the following typical directory strucutre:

/testcases
	/folder1
		/folder11
			ddddd.txt
		/folder12
			ewe.txt
		ddddde.txt
	/folder2
		wrwr.txt
	1.txt

For contents in each single file, we copied some random texts from other place. Including number, alphbetic charaters, and punctuations.

Since we use linked list to implement the main data structure, our program can handle as many files as possible if the memory is enough.
However stackoverflow may occur if there are too many nested directories.
